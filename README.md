# ---Machine-Learning-with-Python-Project
Project is based on predicting the loan status of different loan customers based on historical data and other external factors using different machine learning algorithms.

In the notebook, I worked on a loan dataset and built different predictive alogorithms.

I loaded a dataset using Pandas library, applied the following algorithms, and selected the best one for this specific dataset by accuracy evaluation methods.
